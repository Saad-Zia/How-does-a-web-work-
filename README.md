# How Does the Web Work?
If you are working in web development or cybersecurity or information security, you must have a basic understanding of webpage and what’s going on behind the scenes.
If you don't know how the web and backend work, how you are going to secure.  Below I discuss some basic things to understand how web works.
Let's dive right in…

# What is Web? 
  - The Web is known as a client-server system. Your computer is the client and the remote computers that store electronic files are the servers.
  - Here are some important terms or components of web to have a deep understanding of secret of the World Wide Web...

# Components of Web
 - **Client**
   - It means an application, such as Chrome or Firefox, that runs on a computer and is connected to the internet. Its job is to take requests and send them to another computer called a web server.
Although we typically use a browser to access the web, you can think of your whole computer as the “Client” piece of the client-server model. Every client computer has a unique address called an IP address that other computers can use to identify it.

 - **Server**
    - It is a remote computer which provides information or particular services and also has an IP address.  A server waits for requests from other machines (e.g. a client) and responds to them.
The server has special server software installed and running which tells it how to respond to incoming requests from your browser. The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.
There are many types of servers, including web servers, database servers, file servers, application servers, and more.
(In this paper, we’re talking about web servers.)

 - **IP Address**
   - It is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or on the local network. Every computer on the internet has an IP address that it uses to identify and communicate with other computers.  It looks like this
104.16.66.85

 - **An internet connection **
   - This is provided by an ISP and connects you to the internet to reach to any Website.
Internet Service Provider. ISP is the middle man between the client and servers. When your browser gets a request from you to go to www.github.com, it doesn’t know where to look for www.github.com. So it’s the ISP’s job to do a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup to ask what IP address the site you’re trying to visit is configured to.
